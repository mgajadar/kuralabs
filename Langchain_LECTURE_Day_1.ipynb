Different concepts, like \"company revenue\" and \"office locations,\" will be very far apart.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Embed & Store:** First, you take all your processed text chunks, create an embedding for each one, and store them all in your Vector Store. This is a one-time setup process.\n",
        "2.  **Embed the Query:** When a user asks a question, you take their question and use the *same* embedding model to create a vector from it.\n",
